## What is PARA? 

In short, [PARA](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) is a system designed by [Tiago Forte](https://fortelabs.co/start-here/) that help you organise your digital information, by categorizing files and documents into the following:
1. Projects: Short-term efforts with a certain goal
2. Areas: Ongoing responsibilities or commitments
3. Resources: A range of topics you’re interested in and learning about
4. Archives: Completed projects, areas or resources that you no longer need or are interested in

For details, please refer to [Tiago Forte's explanation](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/)~
